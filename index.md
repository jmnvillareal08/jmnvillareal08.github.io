In 2018, I became the main responsible for the design and development of a Medical Device System, from Design Inputs to Design Transfer. After gathering design inputs from medical consultant and medical journals, I have made the 3D models through SolidWorks and did design review with the Principal Engineer. I designed and authored all drawings for this project as well to ensure manufacturability, ease of assembly, and compliance to ISO 13485 and ASME Y14.5. 

One of the key developments I did for this project was the in-house manufacturing of Trays used for the implants and instrument. Prior to this, an external supplier designed and developed trays for each system. However, since there is an MOQ, it became unsustainable and needed a new solution. Hence, I developed models, drawings, and processes needed for the in-house production of tray and its accessories (i.e., Caddies, Brackets, Silicone Holders) during this project. 

I also had collaborative efforts with the team for the other documents needed in this project. One of the notable documents I created for this project was the Surgical Technique which uses standard rendering from SolidWorks instead of using a third-party rendering program (i.e., Keyshot). I have created standard materials, determined the correct rendering settings, established method for continuousness and reproducibility of rendered images. By using SolidWorks, we had saved man-hours on file transferring various assembly configurations countless repetitive set-up and rigging just to replicate views that we will rework or continued in the next steps.
